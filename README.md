## Overview
The Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI) Biogeochemical (BGC) Sensor Data Best Practices and User Guide is the result of an NSF-funded (OCE2033919) grass-roots community effort to broaden the use of OOI biogeochemical sensor data and increase community capacity to produce analysis-ready data products. The guide includes five chapters: The Introduction (Chapter 1) provides information on the OOI program, including  data access, processing, and recommended end user QA/QC relevant to all OOI biogeochemical sensors, and Chapters 2-5 cover the following groups of BGC variables and associated sensors: Dissolved oxygen, nitrate, carbonate chemistry, and bio-optics.

This repository contains the notebooks, supporting code, functions, and data used in processing the Worked Examples in the individual chapters of the OOI BGC Sensor Data Best Practices & User Guide. The repository includes separate folders with the Worked Example calculations for each chapter, which parallel the pseudo-code included in the chapters of the document text. This data processing code is intended solely as a reference and supplementary resource, and not as a template for end user data processing.
